Shall I compare thee to a $adj1 $noun1 

Thou art more $noun2 and more $adj2

$adj3 $noun3 do $verb1 the darling $noun4 of May. 

And summer’s $noun5 hath all too short a $bodyPart1 

Sometimes too $adj4 the $bodyPart2 of $location1 shines. 

And often is his $color1 $noun5 dimm’d. 

And every $location2 from $location3 sometimes declines. 

By chance, or nature’s changing $noun7, un- $verb2 ed. 

But thy eternal $noun7 shall not $verb3 

Nor lose possession of that fair $noun9 thou owst’. 

Nor shall $celebrity1 brag thou wander’st in his $bodyPart2

When in $adj5 $noun10 to time thou grow’st. 

So long as $livingThing1 s can $verb4 or $livingThing2 s can $verb5

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
