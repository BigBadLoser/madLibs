Met a woman who I thought was vegan, but I had never met herbivore. So then I asked her “What do you call a $livingThing1 with no $bodyPart1. And yaknow what she says? “Please don’t talk about meat, I’m vegan.” So then I asked why the vegan crossed the $noun1! To protest for the $livingThing2! $adj1 mis-steak. So then I asked, how many vegans does it take to change a $noun2. Two! One to remove the $noun3 and one to check for animal by-products. So why does vegan cheese taste $adj2? Because it hasn’t been tested on mice. A vegetarian couple hear’s their son is returning from college. “Kill the $adj3 $livingThing3, $name1! Our prodigal son is returning! But WHAT IS THE DEAL with fascist vegans? They’re just so lactose intolerant, you know what I mean? Thank you everyone, you have a $adj4 $noun4.
